# MedicinesWasteManagement
A medicine wastage reduction website can be made sustainable and scalable by using cloud hosting, modular design, and integrating with other systems such as electronic health records or pharmacy systems. These features can help ensure that the website can handle increasing traffic and data storage requirements as it grows, while also making it easier to add new features or scale up existing ones as needed. Additionally, the website can leverage social media and other outreach strategies to promote user adoption and increase its impact.
